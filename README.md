# Glass patters TMS
 Individual alpha TMS stimulation for a personalised learning

 Three groups:

 - match: TMS stimulation at individual alpha frequency (IAF)
 - mismatch: TMS stimulation at IAF+1 or IAF-1  (half/half)
 - sham (TMS coil placed "wrongly", they perceive the noise and same feelings but not the actual stimulation)

Aims:

 Connectivity differences between groups and pre and post TMS at source level.

Source localization (template) and connectivity analysis is done using Brainstorm toolbox:
